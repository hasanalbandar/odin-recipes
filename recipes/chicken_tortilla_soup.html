<p>My chicken tortilla soup is not a fast recipe, but it is one of the greatest chicken soup experiences known to man.
     The smoky, spicy, slowly simmered tomato chicken broth is made from scratch, and the soup is topped with all your favorite garnishes: toasted tortilla strips, sour cream, avocado, cilantro, lime, and crumbled Mexican cheese.</p>
<p>In the recipe below we will provide ingridients and steps to bring this Mexican dish to life!</p>
<p>Ingridients</p>
<ul>
    <li>1 (4 1/2 pound) whole chicken</li>
    <li>3 white onions, halved, divided</li>
    <li>1 bunch cilantro</li>
    <li>Mexican Oregano</li>
    <li>Dried Chilli</li>
    <li><strong>12 Corn Tortillas</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Steps</p>
<ol>
    <li>Do something with the chicken</li>
    <li>I assume the cilantro is compressed in hydraulic press</li>
    <li>Subscribe to a dodgy website for adult content</li>
    <li>Serve the dish to your dog</li>
</ol>
<p>And there you have it, an abomination, it serves 12 people but your fat arse probably ate it yourself</p>
